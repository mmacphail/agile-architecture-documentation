# Principles
The principles section allows you to summarise those principles that have been used (or you are using) to design and build the software.

# Intent
The purpose of this section is to simply make it explicit which principles you are following. These could have been explicitly asked for by a stakeholder or they could be principles that you (i.e. the software development team) want to adopt and follow.

# Structure
If you have an existing set of software development principles (e.g. on a development wiki), by all means simply reference it. Otherwise, list out the principles that you are following and accompany each with a short explanation or link to further information. Example principles include:

Architectural layering strategy.<br>
No business logic in views.<br>
No database access in views.<br>
Use of interfaces.<br>
Always use an ORM.<br>
Dependency injection.<br>
The Hollywood principle (don't call us, we'll call you).<br>
High cohesion, low coupling.<br>
Follow SOLID (Single responsibility principle, Open/closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, Interface segregation principle, Dependency inversion principle).<br>
DRY (don't repeat yourself).<br>
Ensure all components are stateless (e.g. to ease scaling).<br>
Prefer a rich domain model.<br>
Prefer an anaemic domain model.<br>
Always prefer stored procedures.<br>
Never use stored procedures.<br>
Don't reinvent the wheel.<br>
Common approaches for error handling, logging, etc.<br>
Buy rather than build.<br>
...<br>
# Motivation
The motivation for writing down the list of principles is to make them explicit so that everybody involved with the software development understands what they are. Why? Put simply, principles help to introduce consistency into a codebase by ensuring that common problems are approached in the same way.

# Audience
The audience for this section is predominantly the technical people in the software development team.

# Required
Yes, all technical software documentation should include a summary of the principles that have been or are being used to develop the software.
